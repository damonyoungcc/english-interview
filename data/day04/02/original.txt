5.progress – We track progress with daily stand-ups and sprints. – moving forward or improving
6.arrogance – I believe in collaboration, not arrogance. – thinking you're better than others
7.tendency – I have a tendency to double-check every pull request. – something you often do
8.consistent – I maintain consistent coding style across components. – always the same or steady
9.constant – We faced constant API changes during the integration. – never stopping
10.integration – I handled third-party API integration with error fallback. – combining things to work together
11.priority – Improving performance was our top priority. – something more important than others
12.strategy – We used a mobile-first strategy for responsive design. – a plan to reach a goal
13.optimized – I optimized the bundle size by lazy loading components. – made better or faster
14.performance – We improved page performance by caching API data. – how well something works
15.collaborate – I collaborated with backend engineers to define the API contract. – work together
16.demonstrate – I demonstrated the prototype to stakeholders using Storybook. – show how something works
